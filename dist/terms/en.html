  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <p>
    Telegram Reminder is a personal reminder service.
    The app is provided free of charge and “as is”.
  </p>

  <p>
    Users are responsible for the content of their reminders.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not guarantee uninterrupted delivery of reminders,
    although we strive to provide it.
  </p>

  <p>
    By using the app, you agree to these terms.
